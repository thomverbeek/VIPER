 `VIPERModule` is a composable assembler that constructs VIPER components based on constraints.
 
 Particularly, it assembles the following components:

 - Interactor: Communicates with the specified Router.
 - Presenter: Maps the Interactor's PresenterModel into the View's ViewModel.
 - Router: Retains the subscription of the communication loop between components.
 
 It defines strict guidelines that VIPER configurations must adhere to and ensures that
 communication between components is set up. This guarantees that any vended VIPER assembly will
 communicate in identical manner, regardless of whether the assembly is for production or testing. It is
 therefore a final class.
